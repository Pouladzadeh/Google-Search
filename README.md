# Google-Search

I have designed a front-end for Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

By typing in a query into Google’s homepage and clicking the “Google Search” button. It begins with https://www.google.com/search, the route on Google’s website that allows for searching.
